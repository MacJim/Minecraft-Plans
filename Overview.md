## Nether Hub

Refer to Hermitcraft Season 6 design: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PJgr2EyWm8>

## Ocean Monument base

TODO: Add link.

Refer to Xisuma's design: <>

4 sides of my base:

1. Storage area & entrance to farms.
    1. Farm produces are directly sent to the storage room.
2. Super smelter.
3. Entrance & nether portal.
4. AFK toggle room: toggles all my farms near my new base on or off.

## Slime farm near the whole new base

Bonus goal: Build a mini-MacJim statue (like the mini-Tango statue in HermitCraft season 6) to hold the collected slime balls.

Bonus goal: Send the slime balls directly to my storage area.

## Guardian farm near my new base

Use Xisuma's dropping design. Same as 1.13.

## Bamboo & sugar cane farm near the new base

Use ilmango's 0-tick shifting floor design.

## Bee farm

Build a bee farm in the perfect hexagon shape.

See macOS screenshots on 2019-12-18.

## Villager breeder and Automatic Potato & Carrot farm

Use ImpulseSV's version 1.14.4 design.

Note:

1. Uses villager from the Villager breeder.
2. The farm must be at least 64 blocks away from any village or the farmer villagers will just try to get to that village without tending crops.

## Villager trading hall

Design:

1. The exterior should now be a gorgeous house rather than plain concrete.
2. The interior is illuminated by end rods.
3. The breeder stands below the trading room under a plane of glass.

## Iron golem farm

Use Gnembon's 1.14.4 design:

- In action: <>

## Efficient fully automatic cobblestone generator (using TNT duplication bug)

An example by Mumbo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtm_iuHRXE> on March 14th, 2019.

Build it as part of a mine (Xisuma's HermitCraft Season 7 design).

## Efficient concrete maker

TODO: Add link.

Use Mumbo's design: <>

## Super smelter

TODO: Add link.

Use Mumbo's minecart based design: <>

## Melon & pumpkin farm near my new base

Use ilmango's design: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np27TEnd3Qk>.

## Wither rose farm

## Passive & hostile mob farm

See Xisuma's video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcaWMU1R5kY>

## Pillager emerald farm

TODO: Add link.

Use Xisuma's design: <>

## Flower farm



## Automatic wool farm

Wool farm using 1.14 dispenser / shears mechanics.

~~This farm might be laggy and is best built in the End.~~

Tango and Impulse's design: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5OZzzV3zWU>

Probably build it under my ice farm.

## Massive mooshroom farm

1. Use water currents to push mooshrooms in a circular path.
2. AFK right click with wheat.
3. Open a small gap to push the baby mooshrooms out.
4. Use lava to kill baby mooshrooms when they are grown.

This farm might be laggy and is best built in the End.

## Fish farm (seem quite useless though)

Use docm77's / ilmango's 1.13 design. They should work in 1.14 as well.
