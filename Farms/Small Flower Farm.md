## Flower Types and Dye Colors

"Small flower" refers to 1-block-tall flowers.
The rest of this document deal with "small flowers" only and refers them as simply "flowers".

When building a "small flower" farm, prioritize on those not available as "tall flowers".

Dye Color | Flower Types | Small Flower Only
--- | --- | ---
White Dye | Lily of the Valley | **YES**
Light Gray Dye | Azure Bluet, Oxeye Daisy, White Tulip | **YES**
Red Dye | Poppy, Red Tulip, Rose Bush | NO
Orange Dye | Orange Tulip | **YES**
Yellow Dye | Dandelion, Sunflower | NO
Light Blue Dye | Blue Orchid | **YES**
Blue Dye | Cornflower | **YES**
Magenta Dye | Allium, Lilac | NO
Pink Dye | Pink Tulip, Peony | NO

## Small Flower Biomes

1. Flower Forest: every single block high flower except for Blue Orchid and Wither Rose
2. Swamp: Blue Orchid

## Flower Generation Notes

1. Flowers need light to grow if bone meal is used on a grass block.
2. When flowers spawn from bone meal, the type spawned depends on the X/Z position in the world. In a flower forest, any given coordinate can only ever spawn one type of flower. Thus, I'll need to build plenty of these farms in the flower forest biome.
3. 2 block high flowers are only generated upon world generation. To obtain these flowers infinitely, use bone meal directly on them.
